    <h2><center><u>Artificial Neural Network For The Assessment Of Probability Of Winning From A Game State In Dobo</u></center></h2>
	<b><u>Description:</u></b><br>
	<i><p style="margin-left: 40px"> &emsp;A Neural Net will be made to assess the probability of winning from a game state, with input being n neurons representing the partitions of the board and output being one neuron, with a value representing the probability of winning from the game state. First, a game state table will be made, with entries to represent a game state, and the probability of winning from that game state. After each game the sequence of states will be analyzed, the probability of a state in the winning sequence of moves will be incremented and the probability of winning from a game state in the losing sequence will be decremented. Once the game state table is made the Neural Net will be trained with the game table data and weights adjusted properly with a genetic algorithm using the absolute value of the difference of the output of the net and the table entry value, summed over all entries. Finally once the Neural Net is trained, a Neural Net Player will have the power of a Neural Net to assess its next possible choices of moves, and will pick the move with the assessed highest probability of winning

	<blockquote><i>A player will be modelled that uses a game state table to select its next move. The decision of what move to make will be made by using the possible moves list on the current game state to produce all next possible states. Then a parallel list will be made consisting of the retrieved value of each of those states from the game state table. The player will then select the state parallel to the highest retrieved probability value, and remove the move corresponding to that state from another parallel list structure.</i><br></blockquote>

	Task 7: Converge the probability values of the game table<br>

	<blockquote><i>The probability values will be converged through playing a set number of games and processing them in reverse, increasing the probability of winning of the states in the winning move sequence and decreasing the probability of winning of the states in the losing move sequence. For this to happen, a player that uses the game-state-table to select the best move will play a random player, and whenever the random player manages to win, the game will be analyzed, adjusting the probability of each state by a factor of the amount of hits present in the losing game state which will be hit on every analyzation of the game by nature. This will allow for larger adjustments to take place as the table lookup player gains more knowledge about the game. Below you will find a graph of the win ratio of a 3x3 player over time while training, the trend indicating a steady state of 100% is being reached, showing effective training.</i><br></blockquote>
