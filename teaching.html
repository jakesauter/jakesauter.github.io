						<p style="font-size:135%">I have had a desire to teach from a young age. I have always enjoyed tutoring my peers and have done so from highschool computer science club and in classes to as a paid lab assistant/tutor at SUNY Fredonia as well as frequently being of assistance to peers in the fourth floor of the Shineman Science Center in the Computer Science wing at SUNY Oswego. I will soon be pursuing a graduate degree in Computational Neuroscience with hopes of becoming a researcher and a professor, aiding other students in the pursuit of knowledge in my domain</p><p style="font-size:135%" >Possibly my most noteable teaching experience was at iD Tech Camps, teaching a range of students aging 7 to 17 and teaching courses such as Scratch Programming to Mobile App development with Scratch as well as More advanced classes in Java and C++ with focus on object-oriented programming with students devoting a week to learning the languages and techniques, and applying them to a project for the second half of the week to show during family showcase at the end of the week experience at camp.I went through 7 cycles of this and got to hone my teaching skills through the weeks to better my teaching ability. </p>
