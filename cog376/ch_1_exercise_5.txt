The lexical_diversity method introduced calculates len(text)/len(set(text)). What this calculation really means is the ratio of the size of the set of tokens in the text vs. the size of the set of unique tokens in the text. For example if this number returned was 1.5, it would mean that the size of the text is 1.5 times the size of the set of the unique tokens, so the closer this number is to 1, the less repeated unique tokens exist in the text. This being said, in table 1.1, we can find the lexical diversity score of humor to be 4.3 and of romance fiction to be 8.3, meaning that humor is more lexically diverse than romance fiction.
