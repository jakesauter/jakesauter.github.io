This python code forms a complex type for a function expression.The argument type shown represents an entity, being a variable that could posses characteristics, possibly waling. The function expressed is the predicate funtion walking, denoting an action of the entitiy. The initial output of the function type is <e, ?> because the type of walk has not been fully specified, so a signature is specified to clear up the type ambiguity. Now, <e, t> is the type of expression from entities to truth values, namely unary predicates.
