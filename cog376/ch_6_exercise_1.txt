Machine translation (both statistical and example based) require lots of
  data. It is clear that example based (otherwise known as translation by analogy)
  needs a lot of data because it must be provided lots of examples (analogies) in
  order to get a correct idea of the translation from one language to another. Statistical
  translation also requires a lot of data because it plays off of bayes theorm, and uses it
  in such a way that the best translation is one that is most likely to be seen in the language
  being translated to, which requires lots of data to analyze.
