* ~0 and -1 is the same bit representation of 111...1
* the exponenet of a floating point is unsigned
* all 1s for the exponenet of the floating point is infinity
* all 0s for the exponent of the floating point is a denormalized number
* the value of the bias is how many left shift needed to map the range of the exponent to tmin and tmax
* bias = half of full range + E
* bias = 2^(k-1)-1
* when we are looking for the largest off integer that can be represeneted exactly we are looking for the point
	that we can stop representing every integer
* we move the decimal point over all of the current fractional bits to achieve a 0 as the least significan bit
	E = 23, meaning 23 shifts, calculate the value acheievable
0
